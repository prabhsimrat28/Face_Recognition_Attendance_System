# Face_Recognition_Attendance_System
The objective of this project is to develop an automated Face Recognition and Attendance System that accurately detects and recognizes individuals for seamless attendance tracking. Using OpenCV, Tkinter, and Pandas, it eliminates manual effort by capturing face images, training a recognition model, and marking attendance in an Excel file while preventing duplicates. 
Key Features
1. User Registration: Captures student details and assigns a unique ID. 
2.  Dataset Generation: Captures and stores face images. 
3.  Model Training: Trains a LBPH-based classification model. 
4.  Face Detection & Recognition: Detects faces and recognizes registered users. 
5. Attendance Marking: Records attendance with date and time.
